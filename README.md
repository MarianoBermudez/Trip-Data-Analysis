## Project Summary

This project aims to understand the behavior of casual riders and annual members of a bike-share service.  
Using trip data from the last 12 months, I analyzed patterns in usage, trip duration, and the days and hours when members and casual riders are most active.  
The main goal is to find actionable strategies to convert more casual riders into annual members.
